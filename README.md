## A place to flatpak apps, for fun!

Presumably these would eventually make their way back upstream to the owning project. But for now I need a place to put them while I experiement or work out the issues.

On the master branch they should be fully useable flatpak apps. On the work_in_progress branch nothing is guaranteed to work - at all.


Currently useable on master:

	- mdBook (requires the Rust Sdk Extension -- more details https://github.com/futuretim/rust-flatpak-extension)
