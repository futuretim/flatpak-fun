## A place to flatpak apps, for fun!

Presumably these would eventually make their way back upstream to the owning project. But for now I need a place to put them while I experiement or work out the issues.

On the master branch they should be fully useable flatpak apps. On the work_in_progress branch nothing is guaranteed to work - at all.


Currently WIP status (probably not comprehensive):

* trojita
* FeedTheMonkey
* gElemental
